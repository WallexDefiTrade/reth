## Labels

Each label in the repository has a description attached that describes what the label means.

There are 7 label categories in the repository:

- **Area labels**: These labels denote the general area of the project an issue or PR affects. These start with `A-`.
- **Category labels**: These labels denote the type of issue or change being made, for example https://github.com/foundry-rs/reth/labels/C-bug or https://github.com/foundry-rs/reth/labels/C-enhancement. These start with `C-`.
- **Difficulty labels**: These are reserved for the very easy or very hard issues. Any issue without one of these labels can be considered to be of "average difficulty". They start with `D-`.
- **Meta labels**: These start with `M-` and convey meaning to the core contributors, usually about the release process.
- **Platform labels**: These describe the platform an issue is present on. They start with `O-`.
- **Priority labels**: These are reserved for issues that require more immediate attention (high priority and critical priority) and they start with `P-`.
- **Status labels**: These labels convey meaning to contributors about an issue or PR's status, e.g. whether they are blocked or need triage. They start with `S-`.

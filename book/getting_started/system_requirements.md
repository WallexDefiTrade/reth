# System Requirements

## Hardware
- For an Archive node of Ethereum Mainnet, we recommend at least 3TB storage space: 1.8TB for state and 200GB for temp files 

- We recommend using an SSD or NVMe, as an HDD may cause the node to fall behind the chain tip. Note that SSD performance can deteriorate when close to capacity.
- We recommend a minimum of 16GB RAM and a 64-bit architecture.

## Software
- rustc 1.66.0 (69f9c33d7 2022-12-12)
- libclang-dev
- pkg-config

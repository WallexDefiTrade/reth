# ðŸš§ WARNING: UNDER CONSTRUCTION ðŸš§

This project is work in progress and subject to frequent changes as we are still working on wiring up each individual node component into a full syncing pipeline.

It has not been audited for security purposes and should not be used in production yet.

We will be updating the documentation with the completion status of each component, as well as include more contributing guidelines (design docs, architecture diagrams, repository layouts) and "good first issues". See the "Contributing and Getting Help" section below for more.

We appreciate your patience until we get there. Until then, we are happy to answer all questions in the Telegram link above.

# What does this solve? Why a new Rust implementation?

Reth is a new Apache/MIT-licensed full node implementation of Ethereum focused on contributor friendliness, modularity, and performance. Reth does not include code from any existing client but stands on the shoulders of giants including Geth, Erigon, OpenEthereum, Akula and more.

Our goals are:
1. **Modularity**: Every component of Reth is built to be used as a library: well-tested, heavily documented and benchmarked. We envision that developers will import the node's crates, mix and match, and innovate on top of them. To achieve that, we are licensing Reth under the Apache/MIT permissive license.
2. **Performance**: Reth aims to be fast, so we used Rust and the [Erigon staged-sync](https://erigon.substack.com/p/erigon-stage-sync-and-control-flows) node architecture. We also use our Ethereum libraries (including [ethers-rs](https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs/) and [revm](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm/)) which weâ€™ve battle-tested and optimized via [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/).
3. **Free for anyone to use any way they want**: Reth is free open source software, built for the community, by the community. By licensing the software under the Apache/MIT license, we want developers to use it without being bound by business licenses, or having to think about the implications of GPL-like licenses.
4. **Client Diversity**: The Ethereum protocol becomes more antifragile when no node implementation dominates. This ensures that if there's a software bug, the network does not finalize a bad block. By building a new client, we hope to contribute to Ethereum's antifragility.
5. **Support as many EVM chains as possible**: We aspire that Reth can full-sync not only Ethereum, but also other chains like Optimism, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, and more. If you're working on any of these projects, please reach out.
6. **Archive & pruned nodes, full sync and fast syncs**: We want to solve for node operators that care about fast historical queries, but also for hobbyists who cannot operate on large hardware. We also want to support teams and individuals who want both sync from genesis and via "fast sync". We envision that Reth will be configurable enough and provide configurable "profiles" for the tradeoffs that each team faces.

## Security

See [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md).

## Acknowledgements

* Coming Soon :) "Reth Lineage" will be an attempt at doing a historical analysis of the innovations of every client that has existed. We stand on the shoulders of giants, and none of this would have been possible without them.

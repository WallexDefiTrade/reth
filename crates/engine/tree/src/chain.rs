/// invariants apply:
///  - If the handler requests a pipeline run (e.g. [`PipelineAction::SyncPipeline`]), the handler
///    must ensure that while the pipeline is running, no other write access is granted.
///  - At any time the [`ChainOrchestrator`] can request exclusive write access to the database
///    (e.g. if pruning is required), but will not do so until the handler has acknowledged the
///    request for write access.
///
/// The [`ChainOrchestrator`] polls the [`ChainHandler`] to advance the chain and handles the
/// emitted events. Requests and events are passed to the [`ChainHandler`] via
/// [`ChainHandler::on_event`].

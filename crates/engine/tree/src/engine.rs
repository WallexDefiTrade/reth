///
/// This type is an orchestrator for incoming messages and responsible for delegating requests
/// received from the CL to the handler.
///
/// It is responsible for handling the following:
/// - Downloading blocks on demand from the network if requested by the [`EngineApiRequestHandler`].
///
/// The core logic is part of the [EngineRequestHandler], which is responsible for processing the
/// incoming requests.

/// - `on_new_payload`: Executes the payload and inserts it into the tree. These are allowed to be
///   processed concurrently.
/// - `on_forkchoice_updated`: Updates the fork choice based on the new head. These require write
///   access to the database and are skipped if the handler can't acquire exclusive access to the
///   database.
///
/// The [`EngineApiTreeHandler`] is used to execute the incoming payloads, storing them in a tree
/// structure and committing new chains to the database on fork choice updates.
///
/// In case required blocks are missing, the handler will request them from the network, by emitting
/// a download request upstream.
